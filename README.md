# My Favorite Series: Transformers
## Overview: The Transformer is a science fiction media franchise that centers around the group and sentient living robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron. The franchise began in the 1980s with the Transformers toy line and animated television Series, and has since expanded into live-action films, additional animated series, comics, and video games. The films follow the autobots and decepticons as they battle for control, with the fate of earth often hanging in balance the movies feature impressive visual effects, large scale action secquences, and mix of a science fiction, humor, and drama.
